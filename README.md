Deliverables:	

1.	Mark up a static website (HTML/CSS and JS as appropriate) to meet the functional and technical requirements for Bazaar Ceramics as determined by your research and discussions with the client. The design must also be guided by your content audit, determined site map and wireframes you have prepared.

3.	Your products list page must have a table with at least 6 columns.

4.	The product list page table must list at least 10 products.

5.	Clicking on a product image thumb nail in the product lists table should take you to a product details / description page.

6.	You must have a site credits page where you credit source of all copy and images.
