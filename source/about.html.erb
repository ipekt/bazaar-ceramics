<h1>Company Background</h1>

<p>Bazaar Ceramics Studio has been operating for 20 years. We started as a small collective, operating in the picturesque township of Hahndorf, South Australia - known for its quality arts and crafts. Over the years the studio has passed through a number of transformations. In the first 7 years of its existence - as a co-operative, it was well known for producing quality domestic ware and fine individually designed art pieces.
Each member of the co-operative was responsible for designing, throwing, glazing and firing their own work. A gallery director was employed to look after the gallery and all aspects of marketing.</p>

<p>As the reputation of the studio grew nationally, and production expanded to meet demand, the structure of the business changed to its present form. Kim Hayward bought the business and moved into larger premises in Stepney, Adelaide. The production staff increased and currently includes a production manager, 2 full time ceramic designers and 6 production potters.</p>

<p>Bazaar Ceramics has a wide range of products to meet the needs of clients both nationally and internationally. The studio produces exquisite one off sculptural pieces for the individual and corporate collector. Commissions make up approximately 40% of this work. These pieces can be found in board rooms, international hotels and private homes as far away as the US and Germany.</p>

<p>Bazaar Ceramics also produce unique, individually designed domestic ware, including full dinner sets and ovenware.</p>

	<h1>The Design Process</h1>
	<p>The ceramic designers take regular trips to remote regions looking for inspiration from the natural environment, whether it is the outback or the wild coastlines. Back in the studio their sketches and photographs are worked up into designs, which complement the ceramic forms. The ceramic designers work closely with the gallery director, to ensure that not only is their work unique and contemporary, but is also responsive to the requirements of their clients.</p>

	<h1>The Production Process</h1>
	<p>Bazaar Ceramics are constantly experimenting with new designs and techniques. The process of developing a particular range of ceramics, starts with the design process. The ceramic designers and gallery director meet regularly to discuss new ideas for product ranges. It may be that the designers are following through on an inspiration from a field trip or perhaps the gallery director has some suggestions to make based on feedback from customers.</p>

	<p>Promising designs are developed into working drawings which the production potters use to create the ceramic forms. Depending on the type of decoration, the designers may apply the decoration at this stage, or after they have been ““bisqued” (fired to 1000 degrees celsius). These prototype designs go through a lengthy development stage of testing and review until the designer is happy with the finished product. At this stage a limited number of pots are produced and displayed in the gallery. If they do well in the gallery, they become a “standard line”.</p>
